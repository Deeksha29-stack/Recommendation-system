# recommendion_system

##Overview

This is the code for the Recommendion System. The code uses the [lightfm](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) recommender system library to train a hybrid content-based + collaborative algorithm that uses the WARP loss function on the [movielens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. Once trained, our script prints out recommended movies for whatever users from the dataset that we choose to terminal.
